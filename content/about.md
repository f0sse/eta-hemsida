{{< sectionLargeText title="E-Sektionens Teletekniska Avdelning" style="padding-bottom:0;" >}}
E-Sektionens Teletekniska Avdelning (ETA) is a student-driven electronics laboratory at Chalmers University of Technology. Our purpose is to give students the means to apply their knowledge in electronics. We offer our members access to electronic instruments, a mechanical workshop and our antenna park. The ham-radio station stationed at ETA has call sign SK6AB.

ETA was originally founded in 1935 as an amateur radio club by Chalmers students in cooperation with the university. Throughout the years ETAâ€™s focus has shifted towards general electronics alongside the progress of the electronics industry. Today ETA provides the equipment necessary for a broader range of projects, specializing in electronics hardware.

ETA's operation relies on the donations of people and companies for the yearly auction as well as for the association itself. At the moment, we do not have any official sponsors. In case you are interested in sponsoring ETA, please send an email to the board at <eta@eta.chalmers.se>.
